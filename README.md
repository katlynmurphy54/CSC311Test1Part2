# CSC 311 - Algorithms I - Fall 2020

This is the source code for my submission of the CSC 311 Test 1 Part 2 individual project in Spring 2020 @ EKU.

The purpose of this program is to Write a program to show the growth of the 16 complexity functions in 
Problem 22 of Chapter 1 (page 46 of the Neapolitan Foundations of Algorithms text book).  The growth should be based on the 
size of the problem (n). For each function, use a table with appropriate scale to show the growth of that function. 
Please output the tables to a text file or capture the screen output into a file so that we can study them. Study the growth of 
each function and properly rank them from most efficient (smallest growth) to least efficient (biggest growth). Type the ranking 
into a Word file.  Justify the ranking with data from the tables.
