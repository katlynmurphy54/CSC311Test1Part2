# CSC 311 Test 1 Part 2
The purpose of this assignment is to write a program in Java that 
maintains an AVL tree for keeping Customer objects (with name, account number, 
and balance as their attributes) in the tree.  The nodes are sorted based on 
customers’ account numbers.  The program shall present the user with a menu that 
allows him or her to search for a specified customer by name, insert a new customer, 
delete an existing customer, or print the entire AVL tree.  The printed tree should 
contain the node level number and nodes’ data.
